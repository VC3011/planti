    <p>Interior design or home décor is all about altering the inside of the concrete structures we live in and call them home. If you sit back and think, it is astonishing at how much of the outside we want to bring inside through large windows, wood and stone finishes, and posters of far off places and floral accents that are little reminders of the beauty of the outside that we crave. Of all of our endeavours to include nature in our living environment the most rewarding is bringing green plants within our homes.</p>
