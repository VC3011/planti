    <h1>ABOUT PLANT-E</h1>
    <h2>INNOVATION</h2>
    <p>Despite the fact that we have been active for over 10 years, we are still the only company worldwide that makes electricity with living plants. That is not surprising when you consider that technology development simply takes a lot of time. In addition, our unique technology is patented and complex to work with, making it difficult for other companies to join. To stay ahead with this typically Dutch innovation, we are constantly looking for ways to harvest more electricity, make products more reliable and serve new markets. Our technology is never finished!</p>
    <h2>SUSTAINABILITY</h2>
    <p>We have a high priority for sustainability. Within our company this is reflected in the continuous search for the most suitable, sustainable materials for our products and the (re)use of materials. Therefore we only work with partners and suppliers who are committed to sustainability and willing to think along with us about making our products and production processes more sustainable.

    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
    <p>On September 14, 2009, Marjolein Helder and David Strik founded Plant-e as a spin-off company from the sub-department of Environmental Technology at Wageningen University.

        Since 2013, founder Marjolein Helder has been working full-time with Nanda for Plant-e. In the same year, a large paid research project was started, allowing Plant-e to expand to a team consisting of Marjolein, Nanda, Pim, Paulien and DaniÃ«l. In the following years, the activities, projects and research expanded and became team even bigger. For example, Sharon and Eva have found a place in the team and a 'workforce' was even set up to carry out the practical chores within projects and activities. There have also been some changes. Nanda has said goodbye, but luckily a good successor has been found in Han.
        
        Plant-e has already grown considerably with this versatile team. Plant-e has several projects, but also beautiful prizes and awards has been brought in, but is also still developing and researching more possibilities.
        
        David Strik, co-founder, works as an associate professor at Wageningen University and is still an important link between scientific research and research and development at Plant-e.
